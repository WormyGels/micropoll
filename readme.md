# micropoll
Anonymous polling website created for CS 396 at Western Kentucky University.

## Features
* Create polls with up to 6 different choices.
* Users can only vote on a poll once.
  * This is enforced by a cookie that can be easily cleared. Ideally would have done IP address, but this would have been problematic in a campus environment for testing/demonstration purposes.
* Votes are displayed with a pie chart created with an HTML5 canvas.
